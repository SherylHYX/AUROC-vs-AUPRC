# AUROC-vs-AUPRC

## Diabetes -- Sheryl

Sheryl's data set is diabetes.csv, and the competition is from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/kernels?sortBy=voteCount&group=everyone&pageSize=20&datasetId=228&outputType=all&turbolinks%5BrestorationIdentifier%5D=26144c10-5644-4852-b3c4-50264072b98a

The corresponding jupyter notebook file is step-by-step-diabetes-classification-knn-detailed.ipynb. The file edited by Sheryl is diabetes_Sheryl_1019.ipynb, adding PRC curve and AUPRC,  best threshold for ROC, average accuracy, as well as the average precision score.

The diabetes dataset has a total of 768 samples,  268 of which have positive labels, accounting for a percentage of around 35%. The dimension of the inputs is 8. The KNN model uses risk for validation set to choose K. The scores from the KNN with K = 11 classifier are: AUROC = 0.8215367018771446, AUPRC = 0.6622327480790501. The best threshold is 0.35714285714285715, which is quite close to the proportion of positive data points. With this threshold, the average accuracy is 0.78125.

Now we do the random guess classifier analysis. If we are using a random guess classifier, then we will get AUROC = 0.5, AUPRC = 0.35, accuracy less than 0.65. Therefore, the result from the KNN classifier with K = 11 is better than the random guess classifier in all the three scores.
